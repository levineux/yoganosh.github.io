You’ve heard all about the benefits of practicing yoga. But with so many styles and opinions, it’s easy to feel overwhelemed. It’s time to get the facts straight and those opinions checked.

<!--more-->

With yoga becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. and other Western countries, it is quite easy to get lost in the multitude of names, styles, and techniques being thrown around in magazines and on social media. Maybe one of your friends swears by Mysore Yoga, while another is certain that Kundalini Yoga is just the best thing that’s ever happened to her.

The following forms of yoga are most popular in the United States:

- Hatba
- Kundalini
- Bikram (Hot Yoga)
- Iyengar
- Vinyasa
- Ashtanga
- Anusara

The first and best way to avoid too much confusion when deciding what kind of yoga education best suits you is to educate yourself about the more popular yoga styles taught in the U.S., and more specifically in your locale. For instance, New York boasts more than 300 yoga studios, and offers up every form of yoga imaginable, from Kundalini to Bikram to Doga (yoga for dogs!). Mt. Shasta, California, a town of 5,000 in the flanks of Mt. Shashta, is home to one yoga studio whose teacher, Lynn Lloyd, teaches Ananda yoga and focuses heavily on meditation. If you’re living in a major American yoga city (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco or Boston), check out Well+good’s Healthy City Guides to get a good idea of what’s on offer near you. If you’re in a smaller or less yoga-intensive city or town, try YogaTrail, a fairly comprehensive yoga studio directory.

If you have a lot of options for classes, that is, if you live in a larger city, belong to an exercise club that offers multiple kinds of yoga classes, or attend a university that offers different styles of yoga classes, Dr. Homayun Taba, a Mumbai-based medical doctor and yoga expert, offers useful information to keep in mind when considering what kind of yoga is right for you.

According to Dr. Taba, although there exist several schools of yoga, they are all based on the same foundational assumptions:

- Body and mind are connected; the health of one affects the other.
- Regular practices in the form of asana as well as relaxation are recommended for their revitalizing and tranquilizing effects on the system.
- Discipline that starts at the level of the body soon moves to the mental aspects. The overall effect is an increase in the effectiveness of the individual in whatever she/he undertakes.
- Balance is important in all that one does, neither indulgence nor deprivation.
- Development of healthy attitudes such as cleanliness and contentment.
- Psycho-mental work, through introspective and various meditational methods, with the aim of bringing about clarity of understanding and self-awareness.
- Harmony with self, others and nature.

Swami Niranjananda Saraswati of the Bihar School of Yoga made a significant opening remark about the purpose of yoga for all practitioners in his lecture “Three Aspects of Yoga”:

> "Yoga can mean different things to different people. For many it is a way of life. For others it is a way to keep the body free from different ailments. For some it involves the practice of relaxation and meditation. However, according to the theory of Yoga, the teaching to which I have been exposed, and from my own experience, Yoga is, more than anything, a way of unfolding our hidden qualities and awakening our dormant faculties."

But what “yoga” means for Swami Niranjananda Saraswati and his students at the Bihar School of Yoga is certainly not exactly what it means for others from different schools and techniques, and certainly does not always carry the same significance for Western teachers and practitioners.

A debate has raged in America between yoga as a sport and yoga as a spiritual practice, where some practitioners are disgruntled by the massive profits made by entrepreneurs in the new yoga industry. Yet for others, yoga’s appeal has been based on fashion as much as any other individualized sport in the U.S., for instance running, which saw profits upwards of 3 billion dollars for running shoes alone in 2013. The necessity of high-tech (and fashion) in yoga wear, as in running wear, seems to boil down to a matter of individual taste.
